                <p>App has integrated mechanism that allows to analyze all the visualization sessions and its duration
                    for each dream. Basing on this analysis VISUAPP suggests its users to make more efforts on the
                    dreams that might be slipped out of focus.</p>

                <h3>Control you visualization time</h3>

                <p>Peter Drucker said "If You Can't Measure It, You Can't Manage It". The same approach is working for
                    your dreams. People can better control their dreams if they can see the time of visualization that
                    they have spent
                    on it. With VISUAPP it's possible. Such information is available to every user. Each dream has a
                    counter of visualized time on the right bottom corner.</p>

                    said before, VISUAPP will remind you about the visualization session. With this reminder user will
                    get short message with motivational quotes. That is the moment when vision board starts to share
                    wisdom with his owner.</p>
